# ancestors-location-animation
This is a Processing (processing.org) sketch that creates an animated data visualization of how my ancestors migrated over time on a map. It uses a CSV that I exported from MyHeritage and makes use of Till Nagels' library Unfolding Maps.

You can watch a video of the animation here:
